# CroyEM system

2. Methods to improve particle behavior
    - **Size exclusion chromatography**: Gel filtration can be a powerful tool to predict structural heterogeneity. Whenever possible, gel filtration should be incorporated to the final steps of a purification protocol.
    - **Protein or protein complex stabilization**: If negative stain or cryo-EM analysis reveals significant structural heterogeneity, then the user may consider additional methods to stabilize a structural target in a defined conformation. These approaches have proven to be effective in trapping conformationally variable proteins and complexes in energetic minima that allow high-resolution structure determination. Examples include using small molecule inhibitors, non-hydrolyzable nucleotides (if applicable), Fab antibody fragments, or genetic perturbations (e.g., mutating catalytic residues).
    - **Chemical crosslinking**: One common way to counteract structural heterogeneity is to chemically crosslink the purified sample, such as with glutaraldehyde or BS3. However, crosslinked samples run a risk of producing structural artifacts and this approach should therefore be considered only after a control, non-crosslinked sample has been evaluated.

  - **HDX-MS:** Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a structural proteomics method based on a chemical reaction that allows the exchange of covalently bound hydrogen atoms for deuterium from the solution. This exchange occurs under physiological conditions, and its rate depends on the local secondary structure of proteins. By performing a differential experiment under different conditions, it is possible to track the rate of exchange at the peptide level to localize structural changes on proteins due to the binding of ligand (identification of the binding site), another protein (identification of the interaction interface), or due to changes in physicochemical conditions (temperature, pH), including accompanying allosteric effects.

  - **Crosslinking (XL-MS):** This method is based on crosslinking proteins using reagents of a specific length, which, after binding to the protein and subsequent mass spectrometric detection, provide information about the distances between two amino acid side chains. This technique can detect and structurally characterize protein-protein interactions or characterize distances within the structure of an individual protein. The output is a table listing reliable detected crosslinks and their graphical representation on the protein sequence and on a 3D model.
