In this talk, two-photon microscopy-which uses strong pulsed infrared lasers to produce detailed images inside biological samples-is introduced. It can be utilized to image inside of living animals as well as thick tissue specimens.

The innovative method of light sheet microscopy, also known as selective plane illumination, is discussed in this talk (SPIM). This allows for long-term 3D imaging of dense specimens like growing embryos with less photobleaching and phototoxicity because it uses two objectives-one to illuminate the sample and the other to image it.

# Super-resolution microscopy

{{< youtube BmRRYPDq4bY >}}

In comparison to traditional microscopy with diffraction-limited optics, a range of contemporary techniques are surveyed in this presentation. These include various patterns of illumination (such as STED and SIM microscopy) or methods that construct images by randomly turning on single fluorescent molecules and precisely localizing each molecule in space (STORM, PALM, FPALM).

{{< youtube GcQ24khZzvU >}}

During 20 years of friendship, Betzig and Hess collaborated to create the first super-high-resolution PALM microscope after working independently and jointly in academia and industry. They describe the journey to us, emphasizing how their diverse and unusual backgrounds gave them the necessary abilities to complete the project.
