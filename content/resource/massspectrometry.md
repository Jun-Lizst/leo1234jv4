## Ref. Labs
1. [Mass Spectrometry of Biopolymers (BioMS), Core facility, IOCB-Prague](https://msbiopolymers.group.uochb.cz/en)
- **Bottom-up proteomics**
  - The analysis focuses primarily on the identification of proteins, their post-translational modifications, and/or the quantification of proteins, either using methods based on isotopic labelling or label-free methods. The procedure involves proteolytic digestion of proteins and the analysis of the resulting peptides. The analysis itself is based on liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis of peptides. This allows for sensitive and reliable identification/quantification of proteins or their modifications in the analyzed sample. Protein samples in various forms can be analyzed. We can analyze dried protein samples, as well as proteins separated in SDS-PAGE gel or proteins dissolved in various buffers.
  - **Instruments**: UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano + Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™

- **Top-down proteomic analysis**
  - **Intact mass:** Analysis of the intact mass of proteins or nucleic acids under denaturing conditions. **It serves as a more precise equivalent to SDS-PAGE with a mass determination accuracy up to 1 Da.** It is possible to analyze both pure proteins and nucleic acids, as well as simpler mixtures (up to, for example, 10-20 pure proteins). More complex mixtures, or a very heterogeneous mixture of different proteoforms of one protein, can be problematic; however, it is possible to perform LC-MS separation of the sample before analysis. It is also possible to analyze larger proteins, such as antibodies. We also provide the calculation of Drug-to-Antibody Ratio (DAR) for antibody-drug conjugates as a service.

  - **Native MS:** Native mass spectrometry allows for the study of non-covalent protein-protein or protein-ligand complexes under biologically relevant "native" conditions. The analysis is performed using very gentle ionization, which allows the entire non-covalent complex to be transferred from solution to the mass spectrometer detector.

    - **Purification of metabolites from brain tissue:**
    Brain tissue samples were collected in 1.5ml Eppendorf tubes and then 900 µl of ice-cold methanol/80% water (vol/vol) was added. The samples were shaken at 120 rpm on a shaker for 6 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 17,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, 850 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Then all samples were evaporated to dryness using a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Savant). The samples were then stored in a −80 °C freezer before performing metabolomic profiling analysis. Before injected into LC-MS machine, metabolites were reconstituted in 50 µl of 0.03% formic acid in analytical-grade water, vortex-mixed, and centrifuged to remove debris.

- **Downstream: Targeted metabolomics**
> Targeted metabolomics use tailored mass spectrometry approaches to assess the levels of specific metabolites pre-chosen by the user or the facility. These may include single metabolites for absolute quantitation (metabolite quant), several metabolites chosen to assess a single pathway (pathway analysis), or screening analysis using assays developed by the facility to detect hundreds of metabolites simultaneously.

- **Downstream: Untargeted metabolomics**
> Untargeted metabolomics is a shotgun-like approach that acquires all possible metabolite data from experimental samples with no prioritization of which pathways might be informative. The method reports the maximum number of metabolic features (i.e., “peaks”) and identifies as many of these as possible by comparing the precise molecular mass and MS2 spectra to commercial databases.
