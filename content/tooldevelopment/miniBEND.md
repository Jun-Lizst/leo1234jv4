### 



## Module 1: VasCode Miner
**VasCode Miner** is in the upstream of The Big VasCode system, and in charge of mining of disease causing molecular target)
The VasCode system aims to integrate next-generation sequencing technologies such as whole-exome sequencing, CNV sequencing, scRNAseq to identify potential disease-causing gene mutations. 



## Module 2: AAV-VasCode system
**AAV-VasCode system** is in the midstream of The Big VasCode system. We developed a novel technology that combined a series of AAV capsids that has unprecedented power of transduction in different model organisms, like Mouse, Rat, Pig, Marmmoset etc.



## Module 3: VasCure drug discovery platform
**VasCure** is in the downstream of The Big VasCode system. We developed a drug discovery platform for novel theraputic strategy aganist specific brain vascular disease.
