title: Brain vasculature system

> Our goal is to understand the principles underlying the formation of the brain vasculature system. Brain endothelial cells(ECs) are one of the major components of brain vasculature system and involved in many kinds of brain vasculature diseases, like bAVM, CCM, HHT, IA(Intracranial aneurysm). We are developing and applying cutting edge technologies to interrogate the signal transduction pathways that involved in disease progression.

Our goal is to understand the principles underlying the formation of the brain vasculature system. Brain endothelial cells(ECs) are one of the major components of brain vasculature system and involved in many kinds of brain vasculature diseases, like bAVM, CCM, HHT, IA(Intracranial aneurysm). We are developing and applying cutting edge technologies to interrogate the signal transduction pathways that involved in disease progression.

Early anatomical and cytological studies established the basic cellular composition of the brain's vascular system, including smooth muscle cells (SMCs) on arteries, pericytes on capillary walls, and endothelial cells (ECs) as the fundamental component. Additionally, astrocytic endfeet envelop the perivascular space around the vessel walls. Parenchymal glial cells and neuronal cell bodies are also found in close proximity to cerebral vessels, typically within 15 μm.

## To dissect signaling pathway that control the pathogenesis of CCM disease
Defects in brain endothelial cells (brainECs) can cause severe cerebrovascular malformations, including arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM).
