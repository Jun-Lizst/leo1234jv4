Early anatomical and cytological studies established the basic cellular composition of the brain's vascular system, including **smooth muscle cells (SMCs)** on arteries, **pericytes** on capillary walls, and **endothelial cells (ECs)** as the fundamental component. Additionally, **astrocytic endfeet** envelop the perivascular space around the vessel walls. Parenchymal glial cells and neuronal cell bodies are also found in close proximity to cerebral vessels, typically within 15 μm.

**In order to target brainECs, we decided to create following genetic tools.**
#### 1. Development of a brainEC specific Cre driver line: Slco1c1-CreER-KI

## IV. To explore and characterize the role of bECs in inflammatory response

> **Immune cell infiltration revealed by snRNAseq of bAVM lesion**

We characterized that monocyte and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are the main immune cell types that infiltrate in bAVM lesion. We also observed inflammation-mediated angiogenesis in bAVM lesion. And, Ackr1 gene is significantly upregulated during early stage of bAVM ([Li et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.10.658979)). Ackr1 gene encodes the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1, a.k.a. CD234, also known as the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC)). This chemokine receptor is primarily expressed by postcapillary venules (PCV) ECs (and small venule ECs) ([Thiriot et al., 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12915-017-0381-7)), and transports basal chemokines for presentation at the luminal surface of ECs and in paracellular junctions, where it regulates different stages of immune cell diapedesis ([Girbl et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2018.09.018)) and recruitment ([Girbl et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nri3544)).

**Next questions**

**Other questions**
>  **Q1. The mechanisms of BBB disruption during inflammatory conditions of multiple sclerosis remain poorly defined.**

>  **Q2. What is the molecular basis of vascular regression in the aging brain ？**

While the intervascular connective tissue strands in the central nervous system (also named string vessel or acellular capillaries) have been observed and documented for decades ([Cammermeyer 1960](https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.901140206); [Brown et al., 2010](10.3233/JAD-2010-100219IF)). its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. **A central, unresolved question is how these structures form.** 

Neuroinflammation, a hallmark of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, provides a compelling candidate mechanism. Driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, neuroinflammation generates a persistent stream of pro-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the brain. Consistent with this, we previously demonstrated that both brain aging and acute inflammation induced by systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cause significant increase in vessel regression throughout the adult brain ([Gao et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.15.262782)). While a recent study proposed that endothelial activation of GSDMD mediates inflammatory blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown ([Wei et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07314-2)), its specific contribution to the macroscopic process of vessel regression and string vessel formation remains uncharacterized.

Our findings demonstrate that genetic ablation of TAK1 signaling significantly increases vessel regression in the adult brain ([Gao et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60308-0); [Li et al., 2025](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.10.658979)). This observation is particularly intriguing given that TAK1 serves as a critical nexus in cell death signaling. In immune cells, TAK1 inhibition can lead to the activation of Caspase-8, which subsequently executes pyroptosis by directly cleaving key effectors, Gasdermin D (GSDMD) and Gasdermin E (GSDME) ([Guo et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/cddis.2016.294); [Orning et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau2818)). Although a clear link between TAK1 and distinct cell death pathways has been established, the precise mechanisms governing these processes in brain endothelial cells remain to be elucidated. It is currently unclear whether necroptosis or pyroptosis is the dominant form of regulated cell death in these cells and, crucially, how its specific regulation contributes to the breakdown of blood-brain barrier. 

Building on those evidences, we propose a framework in which the canonical TAK1–Caspase-8–Gasdermin axis, a well-defined cell death pathway in immune cells, is co-opted to drive brain endothelial cell death and subsequent vascular pathology in the context of neuroinflammation and aging. To address this critical knowledge gap, we now investigate the novel mechanisms by which dysregulated innate immunity in aging drives the structural degradation of the cerebral microvasculature.
