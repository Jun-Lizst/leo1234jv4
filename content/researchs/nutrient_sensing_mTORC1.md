# Abstract

Understanding how mTOR senses environmental cues and coordinates cellular growth is essential for both fundamental biology and therapeutic development. We are focusing the question: How does mTOR sense nutritional cues and coordinates cellular growth ?

**One the road of discovering new nutrient sensors......**
