title: Nutrient sensing mTORC1 pathway

> Nutrient sensing is a fundamental biological process that enables organisms to adapt to their environment by regulating cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability. mTOR signaling pathway is evolved to be able to sense environmental cues and coordinates cellular growth, we are focusing the question: How does mTOR sense nutritional cues and coordinates cellular growth ?

# Introduction
Nutrient sensing is a fundamental biological process that enables organisms to adapt to their environment by regulating cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability [[1](https://doi.org:10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.041)]. A key pathway in this process is the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which coordinates cellular responses to amino acid and glucose levels. Despite significant advances in understanding mTORC1 signaling, only a limited number of nutrient sensors has been discovered. The identification of sensors like Sestrin2 [[2](https://doi.org:10.1126/science.aab2674)], CASTOR1 [[3](https://doi.org:10.1016/j.cell.2016.02.035)], LYCHOS [[4](https://doi.org:10.1126/science.abg6621)], SAMTOR [[5](https://doi.org:10.1126/science.aao3265)] and Unmet [[6](https://doi.org:10.1038/s41467-024-46680-3)] has provided insights into how cells detect nutrients such as leucine, arginine, cholesterol, and S-adenosylmethionine. However, the evolutionary diversity of nutrient sensing mechanisms suggests that there are likely many undiscovered sensors [[7](https://doi.org:10.1038/nature14190)], particularly in non-mammalian organisms occupying unique ecological niches. Identification of such sensors should reveal novel regulatory components and mechanisms of the mTORC1 pathway.
