## Personal Statement

Hello, My name is Jun-Liszt Li. I am currently working as a postdoc researcher in [David M. Sabatini lab (IOCB Boston and IOCB Prague)](https://iocbboston.org/#groups), a leading center for nutrient sensing and growth control research. My research focus is to understand the upstream logic of mTORC1 nutrient sensing pathway. At the Sabatini Lab, I have been fortunate to receive rigorous training in biochemistry and mechanistic cell biology. This experience not only refined my experimental precision but also shaped the way I think about scientific questions — emphasizing clarity, reproducibility, and the pursuit of fundamental molecular principles.

Previously, I was working as a PhD graduate student in PKU-CIBR joint program of [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My long-term goal is to discover and characterize basic mechanisms underlying cell growth (Vascular cells and Neurons). In addition, I worked on next-generation gene delivery tools (rAAV vector/capsid engineering), next-generation sequencing (RNAseq/scRNAseq), Proteomics, advanced microscopic imaging (confocal/lightsheet/2p) in order to apply these technologies to explore animal physiology and address specific questions. 

I would like to highlight five publications demonstrating my expertise with RNAseq/scRNAseq methods.
