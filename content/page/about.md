Hello, My name is Jun-Liszt Li. Currently, I am a graduate student in PKU-CIBR joint program of Peking University. My long-term goal is to discover and characterize basic mechanisms underlying brain aging and neuron growth. In addition, I working on Next-generation omics (scRNAseq; Spatial metabolomics) technology, next-generation microscopy (Lightsheet, Confocal, 2p), and next-generation gene therapy (AAV, promoter) in order to apply these technologies to solve specific problems.


## Interest Areas
