Hello, My name is Jun-Liszt Li. Currently, I am a postdoc researcher in [David M. Sabatini lab](https://iocbboston.org/#groups). Before that, I was a graduate student in PKU-CIBR joint program of [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My long-term goal is to discover and characterize basic mechanisms underlying brain aging and neuron growth. In addition, I worked on next-generation gene delivery tools (AAV, promoter) in order to apply these technologies to explore animal physiology and address specific problems.
