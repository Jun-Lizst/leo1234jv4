      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nutrient sensing is a fundamental biological process that enables organisms to adapt to their environment by regulating cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrient availability. mTOR signaling pathway is evolved to be able to sense environmental cues and coordinates cellular growth, we are focusing the question: How does mTOR sense nutritional cues and coordinates cellular growth ?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Brain vasculature system</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to understand the principles underlying the formation of the brain vasculature system. Brain endothelial cells (ECs) are one of the major components of brain vasculature system and involved in many kinds of genetic diseases and neuroninflammation related diseases, like bAVM, CCM, HHT, IA (Intracranial aneurysm), multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke. We are developing and applying cutting edge technologies to interrogate the signal transduction pathways that involved in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic protein structures and functions can now be designed entirely on a computer or produced through directed evolution in the laboratory. AAV capsid engineering is based on protein engineering, genetically encoded ion and metabolite sensors can be developed through protein engineering. We leverage this approach to create a next-generation platform for the study of brain vasculature system and brain metabolic system.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Protocol for tissue clearing and lightsheet imaging</title>

      <description>1. Tissue clearing PEGASOS tissue clearing technique, developed by the Zhao lab, enables the simultaneous clearing of both soft and hard tissues, making it suitable for 3D fluorescence imaging of whole organs. In our study, we applied the PEGASOS protocol to clear whole-brain samples from double-transgenic mice (Tek-Cre; Ai47) in which endothelial cells were labeled with a fluorescent reporter. This was done in preparation for subsequent 3D whole-organ imaging using light-sheet microscopy.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Metabolism is physiologically fundamental to a biological system. Understanding brain metabolism is critical for our comprehensive knowledge of brain function in health and disease. In addition, brain is the most heterogeneous organ across whole body, in order to understand the metabolic basis, a detailed spatial metabolome atlas is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>Protocol for calcium imaging of free-moving mice</title>

      <description>1. Cranial window surgery Chronic cranial window implantation was performed following a standard protocol with the following specific steps for two-photon microscopy. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 4%, maintenance 2%) and secured in a stereotaxic frame.&#xA;The scalp was incised and retracted to fully expose the skull, which was then cleaned by removing all overlying periosteum and fascia using a scalpel blade. Shallow, parallel scratches were made on the skull surface to enhance the adhesion of the subsequent adhesive layer.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In complex biological systems, it is often the structure of the object of study that determines its function. This is also true for neural network systems. In order to understand the complexity of the structure of animal brain networks and their potential functions, brain mapping is one of the important goals in the current brain project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <title>The origin and function of brain oscillation</title>
      <link>https://leoj.xyz/2019/06/14/the-origin-and-function-of-brain-oscillation/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since German neurobiologist Hans Berger first documented spontaneous rhythmic fluctuations in the human electroencephalogram. Many scholars become captivated by this phenomena and attempt to unravel its secret. This periodic change in the brain is known as brain oscillation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary focus of this meeting is to bring together expert neuroanatomists and computer scientists from different organizations to discuss cutting-edge research and applications on brain-wide reconstructions of neuron morphologies from whole-brain imaging datasets. Specifically, discussions will focus on effective data management, reconstruction workflows and common data quality and format standards for data sharing and reuse of manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic neuron reconstructions at different organizations and at different resolution scales.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
