      <description>1. Cranial window surgery Chronic cranial window implantation was performed following a standard protocol with the following specific steps for two-photon microscopy. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction 4%, maintenance 2%) and secured in a stereotaxic frame.&#xA;The scalp was incised and retracted to fully expose the skull, which was then cleaned by removing all overlying periosteum and fascia using a scalpel blade. Shallow, parallel scratches were made on the skull surface to enhance the adhesion of the subsequent adhesive layer.</description>
